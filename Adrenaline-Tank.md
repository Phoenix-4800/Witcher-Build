# Adrenaline-Tank Build

*This build maximises armor resistance with the ursine gear and focusses on adrenaline and boosting critical hit chance and damage by using the Levity rune to make the armor set light armor to make it benefit from Cat school techniques. Rage management lets you cast Quen even when you are out of stamina by using adrenaline points. This means you can effectively have Quen up throughout a battle since adrenaline point gain is very high*
