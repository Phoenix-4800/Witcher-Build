# Monster-Hunter Build

*This build goes all out in dealing with monsters with high resistances to monster, elemental, poisoning and slashing damage. It uses the piercing cold mutation to take advantage of the Aard sign boosts provided by the venomous viper swords. Alternatively you can trade some of the high resistance for more sign intensity by swapping some of the pieces with griffin gear and use it as a Hybrid build.*
